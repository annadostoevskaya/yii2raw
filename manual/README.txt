## About backend part

In deafult Yii2 template, you can see views/, I deleted this folder, because in current template, I want to separate frontend and backend. I assumed that Yii2 will never serve static content. Now, all static content will store in frontend/public/ folder.

I setup NGINX for redirect to FastCGI, when request_uri starts from /api/. Just try get access to http://localhost:3000/api/sys/test in address bar, and check results. You are must get something like this:

    {"request_uri":"/sys/test"}
